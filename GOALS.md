These are some of the goals I would like to acheive within the next few years with using rust as the primary language - <br>

\- \[x] fetch script <br>
\- \[x] quiz discord bot <br>
\- \[o] key value in memory database <br>
\- \[ ] some sort of template generator for eg. create-t3-app rewrite in rust <br>
\- \[ ] wayland compositor <br>
\- \[ ] authentication api for a pokemon battle simulator <br>
\- \[ ] frontend for that api <br>
\- \[ ] text editor <br>
\- \[ ] operating system <br>
