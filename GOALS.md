These are some of the goals I would like to acheive within the next few years with using rust as the primary language -

\- \[x] fetch script
\- \[x] quiz discord bot 
\- \[ ] key value in memory database 
\- \[ ] some sort of template generator for eg. create-t3-app rewrite in rust 
\- \[ ] wayland compositor
\- \[ ] text editor 
\- \[ ] operating system
