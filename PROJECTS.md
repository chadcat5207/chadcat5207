here i will just list out project ideas that i think are cool to make. will i make them, idk

* handwriting to markdown 
    * so using cv, break down big handwritings into headings, and when there are diagrams, take a screenshot, upload to imgur and embed an image. 
    * i could also try playing with written links

* hackernews client BUT WITH login and posting
    * so generally this is automatically better than 90% of the hackernews client projects out there because it actually allows people to login and post shit instead of just fetching apis and just displaying them  

* handwriting to latex 
    * pretty much the thing at the first, slightly different usecase
